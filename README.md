## Introduction

* #### mcc lies around controlling charging in a better way.

## Description

* mcc provides Automated and Manual methods. Auto Switch and
   Auto Power are part of the automation, whereas [--restat]
   and [--enable/--disable] are manual methods. Others there
   are extensions for both these. Auto Switch makes charging
   to stop when battery level exceeds 'thr_disable', and re-
   start when it falls below 'thr_enable'. Auto Power powers
   OFF the device when the level goes below 'thr_power'. For
   details about other features, check options.

* Auto Switch/Power are ON by default. 'thr_power' is 20 and
   'thr_disable', 'thr_enable' are 80, 70.

## Installation

* Flash mcc from recovery or Magisk Manager. mcc will detect
   and install in Magisk > system mode. Only arm-based archs
   are supported. Logs are placed at /dev/mcc_logs.

## Usage

* Run `mcc [OPTIONS]` from a good terminal (such as Termux).
* For escalated privileges, terminal must have a root shell.

## Setup

* Run the [--reconfig] option after installing/updating mcc.

## Options

* [--switch] [thr_disable] [thr_enable]

-> Sets Auto Switch thresholds to thr_disable, thr_enable. A
    good thing suggests thr_enable to be optional.

* [--power] [thr_power]

-> Sets Auto Power threshold to thr_power.

* [--force] [--switch/--power] ...

-> Sets Auto Switch/Power thresholds ignoring all the tests.

* [--revert]

-> Reverts Auto (daemon) thresholds to their defaults.

* [--toggle] [--switch/--power/--revert]

-> Toggles Auto Switch/Power ON/OFF, [--revert] reverts both
    to their defaults.

* [--enable] [level/time]

-> Enables charging for given time or until some batt_level.
-> Accepted formats: {level}%, {time}s, {time}m, or {time}h.

* [--disable] [level/time]

-> Same as above, except for charging is disabled.

* [--cleanup]

-> Kills all mcc processes (even the daemon), and resets the
    daemon.

* [--redaemon]

-> Relaunches the mcc daemon unless already running.

* [--restat]

-> Resets battery statistics.

* [--reconfig]

-> Reconfigures mcc at lower level, requiring charging ON.

* [--reset]

-> Runs [--restat] and [--reconfig] one after one.

* [--info]

-> Shows details about current battery stats, mcc config and
    daemon status.

* [--help]

-> Shows the current README page.

## Examples

* mcc --switch 70 60
* mcc --switch 45
* mcc --power 15
* mcc --force --switch 95 90
* mcc --force --switch 10
* mcc --force --power 4
* mcc --revert
* mcc --toggle --switch
* mcc --toggle --power
* mcc --toggle --revert
* mcc --enable 60%
* mcc --enable 120s
* mcc --enable 20m
* mcc --enable 2h
* mcc --disable 20%
* mcc --disable 30s
* mcc --disable 40m
* mcc --disable 1h
* mcc --cleanup
* mcc --redaemon
* mcc --restat
* mcc --reconfig
* mcc --reset
* mcc --info
* mcc --help

## Tips/Misc

* If mcc causes a reboot while configuring, create a file at
   /data/adb/skip_mcc_root.
* mcc execution will be blocked if '$mcc_dir/lock' is there,
   and the daemon will go to sleep.
* mcc runs in a detached mode, which means you can close the
   terminal afterwards.
* The mcc daemon handles all the switching, CLI communicates
   with it for manual methods.
* All mcc files are stored at MOUNTPOINT/mcc > /data/adb/mcc
   for Magisk > system mode.
* mcc disables logging if '$disable_mcc_logs' exists in env.

## Remember

* mcc will not run for 120 seconds after each boot (safety).
* The [--cleanup] option kills the mcc daemon, too. Careful!
* Resetting batterystats does not work for some old devices.

## Support

* I try my best to make mcc as good as possible. mcc support
   is provided at its official support thread.
